# Assignment Introduction 
A company has come to you as a developer and asked you to develop a mobile application that will work on multiple platforms. They know it is a very difficult task to install all the different libraries and SDKs to do this, so they have told you that using a Cloud based compiling tool is the best option. 

Design and build a mobile application that will use the geolocation of your phone to show the city and country where you are, the weather at the current location, and the currency exchange rate to the local money.

# Technologies 
Adobe Phonegap – PhoneGap is a tool which allows you to write applications in HTML and JavaScript and deploy them to any phone. 
Front end JavaScript Framework – You can use any HTML/CSS/JavaScript based user interface library such as jQuery Mobile, Framework7 or Bootstrap.  

External APIs – In order to be able to access real time data, you will need to connect to external API to request weather, currency exchange rate and name of the city/country where you are located. You could use the APIs used in class, or explorer different options. 
 
# Specific Requirements 
Start with a template source code, the following modifications should be made: 
 
* The application should have a welcome screen that displays the name of the city/country based on the data collected by the GPS sensor of the phone.  
* A section should exist in the application that allows the user to enter in a certain amount of USD to convert to the local currency and viseversa. 
* Another section should exist in the application to check the weather of the current location of the user.  
* Finally, there must be button for the user to save automatically the current location and data collected from the different API’s to be retrieved later, this way the user can keep record of places where they have been.
